"""
My game is supposed to be played by one player,who would control a spaceship (gamebox object)
that travels through obstacles in the outer space.
The goal of this game is to survive as long as the player can.
The player is going to control the spaceship by pressing the "left" and "right" keys on the keyboard
The obstacles are randomly generated above the screen and scroll down with a certain speed.
There will be a timer that counts up, and the scrolling speed of the obstacles will increase
proportionally as the gaming time prolongs.
When a collision happens between a obstacle and the spaceship, the game ends.
This game will use 4 optional features: Graphics/Images, Collectibles, Scrolling level, and Timer.
