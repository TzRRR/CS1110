Triple quotes are special comments known as docstrings.
Docstrings may be single line or multiple line comments.
The first use of triple quotes in a module (program or function)
is a special docstring and contains special information,
revisited soon when we study functions.

Use triple apostrophes for multiple line comments not intended as
docstrings.
