'''
Python data types used in CS 111x:
    int - used for whole integer numbers
    float - used for decimal numbers
    str - used for strings, a sequence of characters
    bool - short for boolean, used to hold either True or False
    list - used to store multiple values in an ordered sequence
    tuple - like a list, but read only
    dict - short for dictionary used to store info in key/value pairs
'''
'''
Immutable data types:
    int, float, str and bool are called immutable data types because once
    the value is assigned to memory the value cannot change. This does
    not mean you canâ€™t reassign an immutable data type variable, it just
    means the variable will name a new location in memory. tuple is read only.

Mutable data types:
    list, and dict are called mutable because they can be changed
    in the same place in memory.

# Use Python's type and print functions to display data types
print("Some data types:")
print("1 is data type", type(1))
print("1.0 is data type", type(1.0))
print("Tom is data type", type("Tom"))
print("True is data type", type(True))
input("\n1. Press enter to continue: ")

# demonstrate promotion: the product of int x float is float
number1 = 33
number2 = 3.33
number3 = number1 * number2
print(type(number1), type(number2), type(number3))
input("\n2. Press enter to continue: ")

# demonstrate dynamic binding: a variable can name any data type
dynamic = 1
print(dynamic, type(dynamic))
dynamic = 1.0
print(dynamic, type(dynamic))
dynamic = True
print(dynamic, type(dynamic))
